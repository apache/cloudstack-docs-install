Welcome to CloudStack Installation Documentation
================================================

.. warning:: 
   We are in the process of changing documentation format as well as hosting 
   mechanism. Please be patient with us as we migrate our entire documentation 
   to this new setup.

This is the Apache CloudStack installation guide, for the Documentation home, 
the administrator guide or the Release-Notes please see:

-  `Documentation home <http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org>`_

-  `Administration Guide 
   <http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/projects/cloudstack-administration>`_

-  `Release Notes
   <http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/projects/cloudstack-release-notes>`_

.. note::
   In this guide we first go through some design and architectural choices_ to 
   build your cloud. Then we dive into a single node quick start guide_ to 
   give you a feel for the installation process. The source installation 
   steps_ are given in the follow-on section for people who want to build 
   their own packages. Otherwise you can use the general installation_ which 
   makes use of community maintained package repositories. The rest of the 
   guide goes through the configuration_ of the data-center and the setup of 
   the network_, storage_ and hypervisors_.
